### Brightcove SSDLC Overview

The goal of Brightcove's SSDLC is to provide product teams and developers best practices on how to leverage software 
security practices into their existing development process. The phases in the graphic above may not be formally implemented 
or recognized by your team, but they do generally represent how all software is developed, implicitly or explicitly. 
Following this model, you are able to best determine what services the Brightcove Security Engineering team provides based 
on what phase of of the development life-cycle you are currently in with your product.

All feedback is welcome - feel free to update/comment the docs directly or chat with the team on Slack (#team-infosec) or email (seceng@brightcove.com).

Our SSDLC is currently organized under the following topics:
- [Coding Practice](./Coding%20Practice)
- [Language Best Practices](./Language%20Best%20Practices)
- [Security Process](./Security%20Process)
- [Tools & Automation](./Tools%20and%20Automation)
